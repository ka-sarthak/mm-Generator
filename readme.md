## Description
In this project, we have implemented a conditional Generative Adversarial Network for generating stress fields in polycrystalline microstructures. The model is trained on quasistatic mechanical equilibrium simulations from DAMASK. The generator is conditioned on the fields of material properties and its architecture is based on Fourier neural operators.

### To-Do
1. Add the data loader
2. Add the training algorithm
3. Add the testing script
4. Add the post processing script
5. Add UNet in the generator model
